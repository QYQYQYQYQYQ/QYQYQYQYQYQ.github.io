**Abstract:** In the field of equivariant networks, achieving affine equivariance, particularly for general group representations, has long been a challenge. In this paper, we propose the steerable EquivarLayer, a generalization of InvarLayer (Li et al., 2024), by building on the concept of equivariants beyond invariants. The steerable EquivarLayer supports affine equivariance with arbitrary input and output representations, marking the first model to incorporate steerability into networks for the affine group. To integrate it with canonicalization, a promising approach for making pre-trained models equivariant, we introduce a novel Det-Pooling module, expanding the applicability of EquivarLayer and the range of groups suitable for canonicalization. We conduct experiments on image classification tasks involving group transformations to validate the steerable EquivarLayer in the role of a canonicalization function, demonstrating its effectiveness over data augmentation.
